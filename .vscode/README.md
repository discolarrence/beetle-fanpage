#   Bernethia's Beetles Fanpage

    This is a page for fans of my beetles. The landing page has a short section introducing the page, a "Meet My Beetles!" section featuring images and bios of my beetles, and an invitation to subscribe to a weekly newsletter along with a link to a signup form. The signup form validates user input and returns error messages or a welcome message customized with values from the form.

-   CSS feature: 
    -   "A navigation menu that expands and collapses properly at desktop and mobile sizes." At mobile size, navigation menu is displayed vertically. At tablet size, navigation is a combo--a logo(links to main page) horizontally displayed next to vertically displayed navigation links. At desktop size, logo and links are all horizontally displayed.

-   JavaScript feature:
    -   "Show/hide one or more content areas or elements on your site through clicking a button or some other user interaction." On main page, clicking on a small img shows a related modal with img & text. Clicking the modal or anywhere on the page outside other than small imgs will hide modal.

-   Other feature:
    -    Javascript "Create a form (such as a ‘Contact Us’ form), validate at least one field (ex: email is in the correct format) and then use that information on your page somehow."
